# Optimization of Routing Problems in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) using Gradient-Based RL Algorithm

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for my research project titled "Optimization of Routing Problems in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) using Gradient-Based RL Algorithm." This project was part of my master's degree in Information Technology, where I focused on applying reinforcement learning techniques to solve complex routing problems in manufacturing environments, where automated object handling can be done using Conveyor-Networks or AGVs.

### About the Project

In this project, I addressed the challenges of optimizing routing within Flexible Manufacturing Systems. The goal was to find efficient routes for objects in complex conveyor networks, ensuring smooth operations and avoiding collisions while minimizing the overall travel distance and time. To achieve this, I employed the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a powerful reinforcement learning technique.

The conveyor network considered for the project was obtained from [Hang Li, "Improve the Performance of a Complex FMS with a Hybrid Machine Learning Algorithm.", *Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, Vol.10 No.3*, March 2017.](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=74672) And figure below is taken from that.

### Key Features

- Utilized the PPO algorithm to optimize routing problems in complex conveyor networks.
- Developed a custom environment using Petri-nets in Python to simulate the manufacturing system.
- Achieved collision avoidance and minimized travel distance and time, improving efficiency in Flexible Manufacturing Systems.
- Demonstrated the applicability of reinforcement learning in solving real-world manufacturing challenges.
